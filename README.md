To run the web app with bat file that already contains Python scripts, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official website.

2. You can directly run the bat file, which can be found in the base directory of the project.

3. Double-click the bat file (e.g., `RunHistoris.bat`). This will execute the Python scripts included in the bat file.

To install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located.

2. Run the following command to install the libraries:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install all the libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

That's it! You should now be able to run the bat file with the required libraries already.
